## v1.0.1

I've added shortcuts for existing commands :
- **/sta** for /survey start
- **/sto** for /survey stop
- **/sli** for /survey list
- **/svo** for /survey vote

## v1.0.0
Following the list of released features :

- /survey start : start a survey
- /survey stop : stop a survey
- /survey list : list all/active/ended surveys
- /survey vote : vote for a survey

Everything is manageable using the game chat commands. All the commands are documented by appending "help".
